Created by Jeremy Bassi as a Project
in an Independent Study in Computer 
Science Course. Inspiration came from
lying awake in bed one night not being
able to sleep. It was made possible 
through information gathered from the
internet and other programmers and personal
experience and ideas. Thank You for playing!
